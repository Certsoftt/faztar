[Google Lighthouse][Google Lighthouse] is an open-source, automated tool for measuring the quality of web pages. Google Lighthouse audits performance, accessibility and search engine optimization of web pages.

### Performance

Audits for metrics like first paint and time to interactive to determine lag.

### Accessibility

Checks for common issues that may prevent users from accessing your content.

### Best Practices

Looks for everything from HTTPS usage to correct image aspect ratios.

### SEO

Checks for best practices to ensure your site is discoverable.

## Installation

You‚Äôll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version. You will also need to a vercel account

To get started with this cra-template new app, you have to:

Begin by

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone this repository to establish your own local copy. This process is straightforward and ensures you have all the necessary files and resources at your fingertips. You can find step-by-step instructions in this helpful article: Cloning a [repository on GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).

Or you can skip step 1 and step 2 by simply running the command:

```js
npx create-react-app@latest my-template --template faztar

or

npx create-react-app@latest . --template faztar //creating react app at root level of project directory
```
`N/B:` your `package.json` should look like this on completing the installation using the above command

*** In case of running into dependency conflict during installation *** do the following:

- copy the command below and run it

```js
npm install --no-audit --save @testing-library/dom@^10.4.0 @testing-library/jest-dom@^6.6.3 @testing-library/react@^16.1.0 @testing-library/user-event@^13.2.1 web-vitals@^2.1.0 @emotion/react@^11.14.0 @emotion/styled@^11.14.0 @mui/material@^7.0.1 axios@^1.8.4 react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0 react-hook-form@^7.55.0

```
- next, copy and run the command

```js
npm install --save dev --legacy-peer-deps
```
- lastly generate your `pnpm-lock.yaml` file (if only this file does not exist in your project), run the command

```js
pnpm import
```

3. Run the app using the command `npm start`

4. To deploy to vercel or github pages or both you have to do the following:

- ### To Vercel

  1. create a vercel account
  2. check out this video on how to create and consume your vercel id: [Use GitHub Actions to Deploy to Vercel (Preview & Production Deployments) by camelcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHVaWZjWec4&t=150s&pp=ygUvKFByZXZpZXcgJiBQcm9kdWN0aW9uIERlcGxveW1lbnRzKSBieSBjYW1lbGNhc2U%3D)

- ### To Github Pages

  1. edit `homepage` property in the `package.json` file as foolow:

  ```js
  "homepage": "https://<github username>.github.io/<github repo-name>"
  ```

  Currently, the file has my repo and username. Go ahead and have it changed. 2. edit and run the following commands:

  ```git
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<github username>/<github repo-name>.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```

  ```js
  npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to Github Pages"
  ```

  3. Visit the your repo that holds the project, then click on the settings tab, go to automation, then pages.

  - Configure the `Build & deployment` settings to the following:

  1. Source: set it to `Deploy from a branch`
  2. Branch:

     - Branch: set it to `master` or `main`
     - Folder: set it to `/(root)`

  3. Edit the `deployment.sh` file to have your own github details.

  That's all!
